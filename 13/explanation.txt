Suppose we're trying to fold for y = 7.

This means we are folding with respect to an horizontal line.

The fold is done UP.

In particular this means that we have to iterate over the lower half
on the board and move each point to its upper part.

The folding is done symmetrically on the line y = 7.

Consider the point

     (8, 0)

This point will move to

     (6, 0)

because 8 = 7 + 1, therefore its destination will be 6 = 7 - 1.

Thus, starting from a general coordinate (x, y), to find the
respective folded coordinate (x', y') we can use the following formulas.

    x' = x
    y' = 7 - k

where

    y = 7 + k


Notice also that when doing a vertical fold, we don't have to change
the number of columns, but only the number of rows. That is, from an N
x N matrix we'll arrive to a N/2 x N matrix.
